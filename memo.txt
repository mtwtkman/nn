# neural network essence
newral network has 3 layers
- input layer
  - provides some input values
- hidden layers
  - detects weight, bias
  - has resposibility of calculation
- output layer
  - generates result value from processing input values

A neuron in neural network means a node in each layers.
A neuron passes calculating result to next neuron.

# Methods
## Perceptron
- can distinguish 2 groups
- has 2 neurons in the inputs column
- has 1 neuron in the outpu column

"inclusive or"
It presents

   A -> B => result
   T -> T => True
   T -> F => True
   F -> T => True
   F -> F => False

So it can divide to 2 groups but "exclusive or" cannot.

   A -> B => result
  (1) T -> T => False
  (2) T -> F => True
  (3) F -> T => True
  (4) F -> F => False

Because if we use 1 and 0 to represent True and False respectly and draw on plain, (1)(4) and (2)(3) are crossed.
